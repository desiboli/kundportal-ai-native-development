"""Reading a ticket's history: GET /tickets/{id}/history (KSP-35).

Covers HIST-03 (entries oldest first, each to_status is the next from_status), HIST-08
(an unknown or non-integer id gives 404 "Ärendet finns inte."), HIST-11 (the same
occurred_at is ordered by id) and HIST-12 (a ticket without changes has exactly one
"created" entry, not an empty list), plus the fields in the contract (HIST section 5).
After each scenario the invariant from ADR-001 is checked through the API: the latest
entry's to_status equals the ticket's status. Part of KSP-39 (Azalea's HIST tests).

PATCH /tickets/{id}/status does not exist yet (KSP-24), so status changes go through
TicketService. The history is read through the API, since that is what KSP-35 builds.
Test proposals: docs/ai/testforslag-v1.md, reviewed by Azalea 2026-10-28.
