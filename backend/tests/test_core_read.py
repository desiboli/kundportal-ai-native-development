"""CORE rules for reading tickets, written before the code (tests first for KSP-23).

Covers CORE-02 (a ticket is kept after a restart), CORE-03 (the list holds all tickets,
newest first, then highest id first, B5), CORE-04 (reading a ticket gives exactly what
was saved), CORE-10 (an unknown id gives 404 "Ärendet finns inte.") and CORE-15 (an empty
list is 200 with [], not an error). Part of KSP-26 (CORE tests).

GET /tickets and GET /tickets/{id} answer 501 until KSP-23 (list and show tickets) is
built, so these tests fail until then. An id that is not an integer (B8) is already
tested in test_error_format.py (KSP-21). Test proposals reviewed by Nicklas 2026-10-28.
