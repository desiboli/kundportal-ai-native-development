"""TicketService: the rules for tickets and where each transaction starts and ends.

Creating a ticket (KSP-22) sets status "new" (CORE-01) and writes the history entry
"created" (HIST-01) in the same transaction (KSP-34). Changing the status writes the new
status and a "status_changed" entry together, with one commit (HIST-02, ADR-001: the
transaction lives here in the service). Status is only ever written here (AGENTS.md).
Listing and reading tickets (KSP-23) and the history (KSP-35) only read, so they need no commit.
